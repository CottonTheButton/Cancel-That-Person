# Cancel That Person!
A Python program that randomly chooses another victim of cancel culture!

## Note:
1. The names are randomly generated from a list of random first names and last names.

P.S. This program is 100% satirical and is also 100% made for fun.

P.P.S. Cancel culture sucks.

P.P.P.S. I don't support cancel culture.
